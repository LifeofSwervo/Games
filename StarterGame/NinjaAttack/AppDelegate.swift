// In iOS and macOS development, the application's delegate is a crucial component that acts as a liaison between the operating system and your application. It is responsible for managing the application's life cycle, handling system events, and coordinating various aspects of your application's behavior.

// The application's delegate performs several important functions, including:

//Application Life Cycle Management: The delegate receives notifications from the system about significant events in the application's life cycle, such as launch, termination, entering the foreground or background, and becoming inactive or active. It allows you to respond to these events by performing tasks like initializing the application, saving and restoring state, managing resources, and cleaning up before termination.

//Window Management: The delegate often manages the application's main window. It creates or configures the initial window, sets up the root view controller or content view, and handles interactions with the window, such as resizing, moving, or closing.

//System Events Handling: The delegate handles system events that are relevant to your application, such as receiving push notifications, handling URL schemes, responding to remote control events (e.g., media playback controls), or managing background tasks.

//Customization and Configuration: The delegate allows you to customize and configure the application's behavior by implementing various methods provided by the delegate protocols. For example, you can control the appearance of the status bar, handle errors and exceptions, respond to memory warnings, manage background fetches, or handle user interface-related events.

import UIKit

// Indicates this class is the application's delegate
@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate { // UI Responder- Base class for objects to respond, and handle events
  // UIApplicationDelegate - Provides set off methods that an app delegate an implement
  var window: UIWindow? // - Represents a visual container for the app's UI.
